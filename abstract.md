BIOMETRIC MATCHING BY HASHING AND APPLICATIONS
=====
This report explores the application of fuzzy hashing for finger-vein biometric authentication, aiming to enhance security and efficiency in biometric systems. Finger-vein authentication, which leverages internal anatomical features, provides a unique security advantage as these features are less susceptible to replication or theft.

The primary focus is on the development and assessment of two algorithms: preHash and postHash. These algorithms transform biometric data into secure hash values that maintain consistency despite slight variations in the input data. The preHash algorithm selects significant bits from the biometric data using a permutation keyed by a secure key, effectively reducing data dimensionality while preserving distinguishing features. The postHash algorithm then compresses these indices into a compact hash. This process is further bolstered by the incorporation of fuzzy extractors, which ensure that even if the stored data is compromised, reconstructing the original biometric data remains computationally infeasible. The experiments conducted involved extensive comparisons, demonstrating the algorithmsâ€™ efficacy in maintaining a balance between security and performance. Despite some challenges, including the integration of previous work and managing extensive experiment runtimes, the developed system shows promise for secure and efficient biometric authentication.
